3. We’d love to hear from you and your experience in working with the technology during this hackathon, positive or negative. Please provide any feedback on your experience with BigQuery AI.
   - BigQuery AI functions like `AI.FORECAST`, `AI.GENERATE_TABLE`, and `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` were surprisingly easy to use directly in SQL, which helped us build a full pipeline inside BigQuery without exporting data.
   - The integration with Python via the BigQuery client library was smooth once credentials were set up.
   - The biggest challenge was handling authentication (service account keys in Streamlit Cloud), and understanding the differences between `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` vs. `AI.GENERATE` syntax.
   - Once those were solved, the workflow was very powerful: we could generate personalized emails, forecasts, and extract insights from unstructured support-call text with minimal additional ML code.
   - Overall, this hackathon gave us a practical understanding of how to combine structured + unstructured data in BigQuery AI, and we see strong potential for applying it to real-world retail analytics.
